Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can\u2019t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn\u2019t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration. \n Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missle and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target. Areas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can\u2019t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. Spells. \u00a0Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. Magic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. Forexample, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic weapon\u2019s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (For example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be supressed as soon as it exits. Magical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spells, temporarily closes while in the sphere. Creatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer withinthe sphere. Dispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere.

The creature remains frightened while it can\u00a0see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened\u00a0by the target, the creature must use its movement to\u00a0move to the nearest safe spot from which it can\u2019t see\u00a0the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from\u00a0the target and can\u2019t see it, the creature is no longer\u00a0frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if\u00a0it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.\u00a0Sympathy. The enchantment causes the specified\u00a0creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target\u00a0while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a\u00a0creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet o fit,\u00a0the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or\u00a0use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area\u00a0or move within reach of the target. When the creature\u00a0has done so, it can\u2019t willingly move away from the target.\u00a0If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected\u00a0creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom\u00a0saving throw to end the effect, as described below.\u00a0Ending the Effect. \n If an affected creature ends its\u00a0turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see\u00a0it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a\u00a0successful save, the creature is no longer affected by\u00a0the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or\u00a0attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by\u00a0the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every\u00a024 hours while the spell persists.\u00a0A creature that successfully saves against this effect\u00a0is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be\u00a0affected again. \n",
