If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. \n\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found. \n\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends. \n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don\u2019t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. \n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph. \n\nExplosive RunesWhen triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one. \n\nSpell GlyphYou can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it.

The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell. \n\nWhen you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects. \n\nGuards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area. \n\nCorridorsFog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses. \n\nDoorsAll doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an arcane lock spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the m inor illusion spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall. \n\nStairsWebs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the web spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts. \n\nOther Spell EffectYou can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold. \n\u2022 Place dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate\u00a0a simple program that the lights repeat as long asguards and wards lasts. \n\u2022 Place magic mouth in two locations. \n\u2022 Place stinking cloud in two locations. The vapors\u00a0appear in the places you designate; they return within\u00a010 minutes if dispersed by wind while guards and\u00a0wards lasts. \n\u2022 Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or room. \n\n\u2022 Place a suggestion in one location. You select an area\u00a0of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that entersor passes through the area receives the suggestion\u00a0mentally. \n\nThe whole warded area radiates magic. A dispel\u00a0magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes\u00a0only that effect. \nYou can create a permanently guarded and warded\u00a0structure by casting this spell there every day\u00a0for one year. \n",
