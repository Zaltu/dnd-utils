# genspelljson.py
This is a ugly hard-coded script to grab the spell descriptions pulled from text form from  
https://github.com/canismarko/dungeon-sheets

The only desire is to transfer the storing of the spell info from python source files to JSON format.  
The actual spell files are not included, but are available at the above repo under a GNU license for the source. DnD may or may not hold copyright of the actual spell descriptions, who knows.
